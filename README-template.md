## My process
I started by creating the mobile-based layout, using a container and two main divs, then when the document started going to larger widths I needed to use grids. I had a hard time adjusting the image to color using only CSS. And also for the height of the Container div when using 900px resolution. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

In this template I learned about changing image colors using only CSS, and a little bit about grid templates.

```css
.image img {
  border-radius: 5px 5px 0 0;
  filter: brightness(0.5) contrast(1) sepia(5) hue-rotate(-125deg) saturate(3);
  width: 90vw;
}
```
```css
  .content  {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 0.1fr;
    grid-template-areas:  "coltext colimg" "coltext colimg" "colstats colimg";
    width: 90vw;
    height: 33vw;
   }
```
### Continued development

I intend to study a little more about grid layouts and alignment adjustment for divs.
